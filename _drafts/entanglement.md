Entanglement is correlation between measurements taken -- even if they are infinitely far apart.

# FTL Communications...
is not implied by entanglement. Why?

Consider for a moment you have two entangled particles to be measured simultaneously that are some distance apart. At the moment when you measure one, the value of the other is fixed. Let's imagine there are two possible values for the property we are measuring and the value of the first measurement is randomly one of the two. Then measuring one gives you no percievable information about the second until the first measurement is communicated to the second place, which occurs at less than the speed of light.

But what if the measurement is known with 99


# Complementarity
Multiple perspectives are needed to yield a full view of an object, and those perspectives can be mutually exclusive.
