Every PM seems to do it differently.</p>
<p>There are some general trends, though. All the good PMs seem to be constantly thinking about the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>The Customer</em> - There's a trap of using the metrics you measure to replace the customer. Adoption and retention don't tell you how the customer get value from this. It happens so gradually, though, that you don't realize that you've stopped thinking about the customer. And this the most obvious part of your job as a PM! So don't forget about the customer.</li>
<li><em>Getting Stuff Done</em> - A good PM is effective not when they issue product directives from on high, but work really closely with engineers, designers, and data scientists and try to fill in the gaps. That might mean making the first version of design to reduce the load on your engineer, or filling out paperwork for your engineers. The basic function of the PM is to reduce the mental load to allow builders to allow them to build.</li>
<li><em>Simplify</em> - There are two parts: <strong>strong opinions held loosely</strong> and <strong>clear communication</strong>. Strong opinions held loosely, with justification, allow your team to push back on you and converge on a direction sooner. Clear, simple communication uses bullet points to makes it obvious who needs to work on what and where the open questions lie. Most PMs don't dive deep into technical details because it impedes this function.</li>
<li><em>Push, but not too hard</em> - The PMs I've seen asks lots of <em>why</em> questions. But they never push to hard on any one thing or undermine the more technical members of their team -- instead, they try to find a way to deliver value to customers around technical constraints.</li>
<li><em>Constantly Communicate</em> - This is the advice I think is most applicable to a start up. Having founders who constantly communicate, even around seemingly tiny milestones keeps the entire team grounded to the product and generates forward progress.</li>
<li><em>Seek Contradiction</em> - this is hard to stomach when you near a deadline, but an incredible way to discover your underlying assumptions. Talk to other PMs, engineers, marketing people, privacy and safety people even (especially!) if you don't like what they will have to say.</li>
<li><em>Global Tradeoffs</em> - Another trap in PMing is optimizing for your own product's success at the expense of everything else. Great PMs "take the long view" and optimize for a great user experience. Sometimes this means forgoing the low hanging fruit for a better customer experience.</li>
