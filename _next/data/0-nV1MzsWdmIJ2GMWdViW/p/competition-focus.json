For example, Amazon or Apple produce hardware and the software running on it and the media running on the software. While <a href=\"https://www.roku.com/whats-on/the-roku-channel/roku-originals\">Roku does produce it's originals</a>, it is not as keenly invested in pushing it to gain mindshare except to allow more space for their ads.</p>\n<p>But Roku also leverages the fact that it is not as vertically integrated to create values where its competitors can't in a couple of ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>allowing conflicting ads. Where Amazon would be reluctant to advertise the new Netflix show since that would cannabalize Prime Video, Roku has less qualms about this.</li>\n<li>self-incentivizing building a better TV experience across the board. Google or Apple may want to push their brand of TV, which is less the case with Roku.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I found this interesting while listening to <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-roku-anthony-wood/\">How I Built This, Anthony Wood and Roku</a></em></p>"},"morePosts":[{"title":"Consistent Hashing","slug":"consistent-hashing","date":"2023-10-26"},{"title":"Rendevous Hashing","slug":"rendevous-hashing","date":"2023-10-26"},{"title":"Python Coroutines!?!?","slug":"py-generator-couroutines","date":"2023-06-11"},{"title":"Lessons from Product Managing","slug":"PMing","date":"2023-06-01"},{"title":"Einsum","slug":"einsum","date":"2022-03-14"},{"title":"Entropy","slug":"entropy","date":"2021-12-28"},{"title":"Try again with sudo: _sudo","slug":"_sudo","date":"2021-11-11"},{"title":"Roku & Competition","slug":"competition-focus","date":"2021-11-11"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
