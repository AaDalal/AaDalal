{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Go fast!","date":"2024-01-01","slug":"fast","content":"<p>A big lament of mine while I prepare for interviews is that it requires you to do things fast, usually faster than is required in the actual job. And speed at, e.g., programming is not a sign of mastery. But I've realized that there is a lot of intrinsic value to being not just competent but fast (and maybe even trading off competence for speed) at programming, writing, math, drawing etc -- skills that underlie the bigger things we try to do.</p>\n<p>I think this is primarily because going fast is fun. And it's fun because it reduces the time from an idea to reality. Of course there are a lot more benefits: increased iteration speed (if you can build something 50% faster, you can make 2x the things), momentum*, and focus. The last one, \"focus\", merits more explanation. Up until a certain level of speed, a task requires concious mental effort to do. Once it gets fast enough, it is so fluent that it requires no thought; you can just focus on the hard stuff.</p>"},"morePosts":[{"title":"Go fast!","slug":"fast","date":"2024-01-01"},{"title":"Consistent Hashing","slug":"consistent-hashing","date":"2023-10-26"},{"title":"Rendevous Hashing","slug":"rendevous-hashing","date":"2023-10-26"},{"title":"Python Coroutines!?!?","slug":"py-generator-couroutines","date":"2023-06-11"},{"title":"Lessons from Product Managing","slug":"PMing","date":"2023-06-01"},{"title":"Einsum","slug":"einsum","date":"2022-03-14"},{"title":"Entropy","slug":"entropy","date":"2021-12-28"},{"title":"Try again with sudo: _sudo","slug":"_sudo","date":"2021-11-11"},{"title":"Roku & Competition","slug":"competition-focus","date":"2021-11-11"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
